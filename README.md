# Factoline
Factory building game. The art is only temporary and will be improved ASAP.
WARNING: The game is nowhere close to playable. It boots, some stuff works, but it's probably better to play anything else for now.

# Download/Install
Source code .zip/tar.gz contains the full game, with Windows Love2D binary.
If you are using Linux, you have to install `love`/`love2d` package. If your distro does not provide it, you can grab it from [here.](https://love2d.org)

# Roadmap
Not ready yet!

# License info
Everything under eggtoast_factorit/code/3rd and love2d is part of different open source project, and not made by me.
I will plan to add proper license file later.
